Description: A collection of functions for identifying biomarkers in NMR
    spectra. Uses the \code{Spectra} class from the ChemoSpec package. There are two
    types of analyses possible with this package. 1. A strategy based on clustering
    of variables around latent components (via the \code{\link{ClustVarLV}}
    package). As part of this strategy, there are functions to "shrinkwrap" spectra
    so that non-informative peaks are eliminated. 2. A strategy based on the STOCSY
    approach of Nicholson. Please refer to the functions for full references.
